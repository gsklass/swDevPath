I have several programs I’d like to write; but I get stuck - it seems like I spend my life on stackoverflow.com; but only end up writing a line of code a day. Code I’d like to write:
* ~I’m part way through the task of moving my 3TB - NAS to google drive; but there are so many duplicate files and SO much that needs to be automated about this process. I’ve written some code (got goauth2 working, simple readers ... but get stuck often).~
I need to find out what happen with with deleting the files - it seems that some files (for example in the Vivian/Picture/Bermuda files are gone - both copies: RFJ and main). In other places it looks like multiple directories have 
ben set up.
* I have ~100K pictures in Google Photo. Over half of which are scanned (and so do not have accurate EXIF info). Since Google and others are able to do facial recognition, I (think I) should be able to use ML to order photos based on aging faces (using good EXIF data for training data). But I need help even getting started.
* I display my pic using Google “ambient mode”; but often want to make changes to what I see. How cool would it be to have an app that would “mark” the picture that I wanted to change; so I could edit it (manually) later?
* I have a stock market (actually ETF) picker; that works well; but the program needs SO much more help. I could use advice on the best way forward. (I am interested in adding backtesting, confidence analysis, alternate evaluation.)
* A trike route suggester based on new miles (from [wanderer](https://wandrer.earth/dashboard) ) or other critera (such as maximizing trails)
* I have MANY fintech ideas (a lot of personal finance) ideas that I want to code.
* Some [APIs](https://medium.com/better-programming/a-curated-list-of-100-cool-and-fun-public-apis-to-inspire-your-next-project-7600ce3e9b3) to inspire new code
* 
*
Non coding (specfic) ideas:
* Learn slack as a way to engage fellow nubie developers
* From RealPython Pod cast: investigate pathlib
* Do a [blog](https://medium.com/better-programming/5-reasons-why-you-should-write-technical-blog-posts-as-developer-30cd349ece60)
