# swDevPath
My path to becoming a software developer

* Figuring out the end goal: master data science with Python so that I can write helpful/personal code. MAYBE this will be the start to a new company
* Learn an IDE - devlop a work flow with VS code and jupyter notebook
* Build a cirriclum: books (?), documenation, websites, video courses, bootcamps - select a path, ask talented online teacher
* Find a community/mentor - online communities, meetups (need to work with others)
* Get ideas from GitHub - and contribute (learn how to contribute from a video)
* Develop a website to show off work (perhaps start link to linked in) - develop online presence
