Technology (Python?) assistance ...

I am a former C/C++ embedded/DSP programmer who took a 10 year leave into upper management, then retired (for 5 more years) and now looking to revamp my programming skills - using Python (I program on a Macbook Pro). I am looking for some “hand holding”. I need help with the following:

* Setting up and becoming familiar with a Python environment on my Mac AND developing a workflow. 
* I have a github account with some “good attempts” at some code; but my git skills are limited
* I have downloaded anaconda; but struggle with setting environments and getting a good workflow
* I have tried VS code; but find myself going back to VIM (it’s amazing the muscle memory of keystrokes that come back).
* I played around with tmux (but I don't seem to be able to remember the keyboard commands)
* I cannot get the hang of Pandas commands. It seems there is a command for everything; but I can never remember what is what.
* I have selected Python 3; but I wonder if there is another language I should consider

[//]: # (I live in the Elkridge, MD area and I would be most interested in-person help; but am willing to work virtually.)

I **could** be interested in forming a partnership with a self-motivated coder to set up a company where we could monetize our efforts; but my goals to start with are a personal to become a better coder. I want to learn how to “fish”; and I can get there by looking at your coding examples.

[//]: # (I am very flexible on work hours and place - a good deal of remote help is fine.  Pay is negotiable; give me your pitch. )
